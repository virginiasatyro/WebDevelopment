# HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals

## 1. My first Web page 

### 1.1 Introduction to Module 1

- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the Web.
- HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main mark-up language for creating Web pages and information that can be displayed on a Web browser.
- Web addresses or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) are used to reference a Web page.

### 1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

- The 'HTML' part contains all the content, organized into a logical structure.  This is the part that an author might be most concerned with: the words, chapter headings, figures, diagrams, etc.  

- The 'CSS' part (version 3 being current) is all about the presentation or style of the page; what it looks like without too much regard for the specific content.

- The 'JavaScript', or 'JS' for short, part is about the actions a page can take such as interaction with the user, and customizing and changing the page according to any number of parameters.  This is what allows a Web page to be more than just a document, but potentially a Web application, with nearly unlimited possibilities.

### 1.3 Elements, tags and attributes

- The "M" in HTML stands for "Markup", but what does Markup really mean? Essentially, it means to annotate a document with extra information.
