1 - SITE STRUCTURE 
	What are HTML and CSS?
	
		* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
		It is used to give websites structure with text, links, images, and other fundamental elements.
		* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change the appearance of HTML elements.

	Anatomy of an HTML Element	
	
		<h1>You're Building a Website!</h1>
		1 - All HTML elements begin with an opening tag. In this case, the opening tag is <h1>.
		2 - Most elements require a closing tag, denoted by a /. In this case, the closing tag is </h1>.
		3 - The website user only sees the content between the opening and closing tags. 
		
	Add a Heading
	
		There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest. 

	Add a Paragraph
	
		<p>Paragraph text here</p>
		he HTML paragraph element, p, is used to hold one or more sentences, just like paragraphs in an essay or a book. 
		
	Anchor Elements
	
		<a href="http://google.com">Click here for Google!</a>
		Anchor elements use an attribute to link users to websites. 
	
	Adding Images
	
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes1.jpg"/>
		
	Add a Video
	
		<video width="320" height="240" controls>
		<source src="video-url.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		
	Create an Unordered List

		<ul>
			<li>A list item</li>
			<li>A second list item</li>
			<li>A third list item</li>
		</ul> 
		
	Add a Div
	
		<div class="main">
		...
		</div>
		Div elements divide your page by enclosing other elements. 
		These enclosed groups of elements can then be organized, moved and styled independently from one another.
		
	Metadata: The Brains

		1. <!DOCTYPE html>: Tells the web browser to expect an HTML document.
		2. <html>...</html>: The root of the HTML document and parent of all other HTML elements on the webpage.
		3. <head>...</head>: Enclose other metadata about the site, such as its title.
		4. <title>...</title>: Contains the site’s title, which is one way users can find your site through a search engine, like Google.
		5. <meta charset="utf-8"/>: Tells the web browser which character set to use. In this case, the character set is “utf-8”. 
		
		
2 - A CLOSER LOOK AS CSS CD 
	Why Use CSS?
	
		CSS is a language used to style websites.
		Colors, fonts, and page layouts for a site can all be managed using CSS. 

	Link to a Stylesheet
	
		The HTML link element links a CSS file to an HTML file so that CSS styling can be applied. 
			<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"/>
	
	Anatomy of a CSS Rule
	
		The anatomy of a CSS rule:
		* rule: a list of CSS instructions for how to style a specific HTML element or group of HTML elements.
		* selector: specifies exactly which HTML elements to style. Here h1 is the selector.
		* properties and values: located inside the { } brackets, properties and values specify what aspect of the selector to style. 
		
	font-family
	
			h1 {
				font-family: Georgia, serif;
			}
	
	color 
	
			h1 {
				color: red;
			}
		1. Hexadecimal color (#RRGGBB): Hexadecimal values that represent mixtures of red, green and blue. 
		2. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colors: Color created by three numbers representing red, green, and blue.
		
	CSS Class Selectors
	
		We can use class selectors to target classes of HTML elements.
			<div class="header">
				<h2>Heading</h2>
				<p>Paragraph</p>
			</div>
		Here, the div is the parent element and the h2 and p are children. 
		CSS styles applied to the header class selector will automatically apply to the h2 and the p.
			.header {
				color: #ffffff; 
			}
			
	font-size
	
			h1 {
				font-size: 60px; 
			}
		1. pixel (px): Standard unit of measurement for sizing fonts and other HTML elements.
		2. rem: Represents the default font size for the web browser. 
		Rems can be used to ensure that HTML elements scale in proportion to each other on various web browsers and screen sizes.
		3. em: A relative value that changes in proportion to the font-size of the element on which em is used. 
			
	A Background Image
	
		In CSS, the background-image property sets a background image of your choice for a given selector, as seen below.
			.hero {
				background-image: url("https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-2/bg.jpg");
			}
		To control the size of the chosen background image, use the property background-size:
			background-size: cover;
			
	CSS id Selectors
	
		For example, to style one anchor element differently than all the others on a webpage, you could use the HTML id attribute:
			<a id="learn-code" href="https://www.codecademy.com">Click here to learn to code!</a> 
			#learn-code {
				color: #2e69a3;  
			}
		1. An id attribute can only be used once because the id is unique to the element it is assigned to.
		2. Ids have greater specificity than classes. 
	
	
3 - BOUNDARIES AND SPACE 

	The Box Model
	
		Every page element has boundary and space properties that can be controlled using CSS. 
		Box model diagram:
		* content: Includes text, images, or other media contained within an HTML element.
		* padding: The space between the content and the border. You can think of this like inner space.
		* border: The outline of an HTML page element. You can think of it like a picture frame that contains the element.
		* margin: The space between the HTML page element and the next nearest element(s).

	Create a Border	
		
		The border property can be used to visually define a page element’s outer edge.
		In CSS, the border property’s value requires three parts:
		* thickness: Sets the thickness of the border, using pixels, ems, or rems.
		* type: Sets the border type. Common options are solid, dotted, and dashed. There are many others.
		* color: Sets the border’s color, using named colors, HEX, or RGB values.
			p {
				border: 2px solid black; 
			}
			
	Working with Padding

		The CSS padding property controls the empty space between the page element’s content and its border. 
		Increasing a page element’s padding makes the space around the content more spacious, while decreasing it makes the space more compact. 
			p {
				padding: 20px; 
			}
			
	Working with Margin
	
		The CSS margin property controls the space between different HTML elements on a webpage. 
		Use margin to bring page elements closer together or to move them further apart. 
			.answer {
				margin: 2rem;
			}

	More Margins
	
		Additional margin properties:
		* margin-top: Sets the top margin.
		* margin-bottom: Sets the bottom margin.
		* margin-left: Sets the left margin.
		* margin-right: Sets the right margin.

	Understanding Display
	
		Using borders, padding, and margins allows us to control boundaries and space for individual HTML elements. 
		Display types determine how HTML elements will be arranged in relation to each other.
		The diagram to the right illustrates the block and inline display types.
	
	Keep It Inline
	
			li {
				display: inline;
			}
			
	Using Float
	
		By using float, we have the option of floating elements left or right. 
			.logo {
				float: left; 
			}
			#search-bar {
				float: right; 
			}
			
	Display: Flex
	
			.parent {
				display: flex;
				flex-wrap: wrap; 
				justify-content: center;
			}
	
	Working with Position
	
		The CSS position property enables you to position HTML elements in exact locations on a webpage. 
		One useful value for this property is relative. 
		This value positions page elements on a webpage relative to where they would normally appear!
		By first setting position: relative;, you can then use the CSS properties top, left, bottom, and right to shift an element away from where it would have normally appeared on the page.
			.container {
				position: relative; 
				top: 10px; 
				left: 20px;
			}

CSS Skills

    * border: sets the outline of an HTML page element, like a picture frame that contains the element.
    * padding: sets the amount of space between an element’s content and its border.
    * margin: sets the amount of space between an HTML element and the next nearest element(s).
    * display: property that determines how the selected element will be arranged in relation to other HTML elements on the page.
    * inline: display value used to arrange HTML elements on the same line as neighboring elements.
    * flex: display value that allows us to easily align multiple page elements vertically or horizontally.
    * float: property used to float HTML elements left or right of neighboring elements.
    * position: property used to position HTML elements in exact locations on a webpage.
